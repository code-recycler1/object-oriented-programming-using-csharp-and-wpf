# Exception Handling Example

This solution demonstrates exception handling in a WPF application using .NET Framework 4.8. The solution consists of two projects:

1. **ExceptionHandlingExample_WPF**: This is the main WPF application project.
2. **ExceptionHandlingExample_Models**: This project contains the models used by the WPF application.

## Projects

### ExceptionHandlingExample_WPF

This project is a WPF application that demonstrates how to handle exceptions in a user-friendly manner. It includes:

- **MainWindow.xaml**: The main window of the application.
- **App.xaml**: Application-level resources and event handlers.
- **ExceptionHandling**: Custom exception handling logic to catch and display exceptions.

### ExceptionHandlingExample_Models

This project contains the models used by the WPF application. It includes:

- **Model Classes**: Classes representing the data models used in the application.
- **Validation Logic**: Logic to validate the data models and throw exceptions when necessary.

## Exception Handling

The application demonstrates the following exception handling techniques:

- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Used to catch and handle exceptions in the code.
- **Global Exception Handling**: Handling unhandled exceptions at the application level.
- **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Displaying error messages to the user in a friendly manner.
